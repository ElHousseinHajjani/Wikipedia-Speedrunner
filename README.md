### Introduction

With just six models, those Wikipedia speedrunners are **BEASTS**. Under the right conditions — good network, strong device, and powerful models — they can break **the limits** of the fastest speedrun, reaching 0.2s with the right Wikipedia articles.  
The project is still in development. In the future, we plan to add **Rust** for web scraping operations to make things faster, while calculations could be handled by C or C++. We will be **happy** to hear your ideas for the future.

### Our Models

Right now, we have **6** models:  
- Model 1  
- Model 1 Test  
- Model 2 Full  
- Model 2 Full Test  
- Model 2 Mini  
- Model 2 Mini Test  

**In our statistics, we use Model 1T for Model 1 Test, and the same naming convention applies to Model 2 Full/Mini Normal/Test: Model 2F, Model 2FT, Model 2M, and Model 2MT.**

### Performances of Models

We tested our models to check their **performances**, steps taken, and time(s). Tests were run under these conditions:  
- Surface Pro 3 (released in 2014), with these specifications:  
  - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4650U CPU @ 2.30 GHz  
  - 8 GB RAM  
  - 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor  
  - Windows 11 Pro  
  - +100 GB to the models  
- **Unstable** network (100Kb – 2Mb)  
- Git shell  

We conducted experiments under these conditions and obtained the following **statistics**:

#### Term of Time

#### Term of Steps  

<img width="406" height="386" alt="ModelsPerformancesSteps" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7451794d-97b2-41c8-97c0-f104dd94861f" />

**For the best experience, we recommend running the models on a computer with at least an Intel i3 2nd generation or newer (AMD CPUs are even good), 500 MB of storage and RAM. Model speed depends on your network’s performance, so results may vary.**

Then we compared performances:

- **Steps:**  
  Model 2 Mini > Model 2 Mini Test > Model 2 Mini / Model 1 > Model 2 Full Test > Model 2 Full  

- **Time:**  
  Model 2 Mini Test > Model 2 Mini > Model 2 Full > Model 1 Test > Model 1 > Model 2 Full Test
